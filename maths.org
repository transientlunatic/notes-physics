** Gamma function
   #+NAME: maths:gamma-function

   The Gamma function is the extension of the factorial function to apply to real and complex numbers.

   If $n \in \mathbb{N}$  then  
   \[ \Gamma(n) = (n-1)!  \]
   such that
   \[ \Gamma(t) = \int_0^{\infty} x^{t-1} e^{-x} \dd{x} \]

** Stirling's Approximation
   #+NAME: maths:stirlings-approximation

   Stirling's approximation is a means of approximating large factorials, and is expressed as

   \[      \log{n!} = n \log(n) - n + \mathcal{O}(log(n))      \]

   which can be expressed more precisely as
  
   \[      n! \approx \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e}  \right)^n .      \]
